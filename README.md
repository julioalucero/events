# Events

## Epic

Youâ€™ve been asked to build a web page that will be used to publish information about different events in Santa Fe (think meetup.com). Every event has a date, start & end time, place and list of pre-defined discussion topics.

## Stories
1. As a user, I can browse events.
2. As a user, I can filter events by:
 - city;
 - range of start date/times;
 - topic of interest.
3. As a user, I can save a search filter and re-use it in the future.
4. As a user, I get notified every time a new event is added that matches any of my saved filters. If I am browsing the site at the time, I would like an instant notification, otherwise, it should arrive by email.

## Production environment

* https://jl-events.herokuapp.com/

## Details

* Ruby 2.4.0, rails 5.1.4
